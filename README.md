Hi, I'm NOT_A_ROBOT!

## Status Update c. December 2024
For the next few months I'll be practicing for an upcoming competitive programming event. This means my contribution rate has massively slowed down. I hope you understand and take this into account if you're interested in some of my personal projects.

## About Me

I like to play nerdy and puzzle games such as Tetris and Kerbal Space Program.

Languages I know:
- HTML + CSS
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- C#
- Lua
- Rust
- Slint
